"""A SQL producer in one object: stage in the caller's transaction, publish after commit,
sweep what was missed.

Every adopter of the outbox used to write the same glue (the first adopter's was 487
lines across eight files): insert the row on the caller's session, remember which rows
the transaction staged, publish them once the transaction commits, forget them if it
rolls back, and run a sweeper on a schedule. This module is that glue, once.

    producer = SqlProducer.connect(engine, bus_name="orders")
    producer.attach()                                  # once, at startup

    with Session(engine) as session, session.begin():
        session.add(order)
        producer.stage(session, Event(type="order.placed", source="shop.orders",
                                      subject=str(order.id), data={"total": order.total}))
    # committed: published now; anything missed goes out on the next sweep

    def sweep_handler(event, context):                 # EventBridge Scheduler, every minute
        return producer.sweep()

PUBLISH AFTER COMMIT. `stage` notes each row in `session.info`. A SQLAlchemy
`after_commit` listener publishes the rows it can READ BACK as committed and unsent from
another connection, so a row staged inside a savepoint that rolled back, or on a Session
whose outer transaction has not committed yet, is not found and not sent; the sweep
publishes it once it is really there. The listener never raises into the caller: the
caller's write has committed, and failing now would report a committed write as failed.

A raw `Connection` (no Session) gets no listener: stage on it, commit, then call
`publish_committed(rows)` yourself, or leave the rows to the sweep.

No boto3 here: the bus adapter is built by `factbus.adapters.eventbridge`.
