"""The only `ChangeMessageVisibility` call in the kit.

A consumer sets a failed message's visibility to its backoff wait, so the next receive
comes after 30 s, 2 m, 10 m ... rather than after the queue's default visibility.

THE RETRY POLICY IS WRITTEN, NOT INHERITED, as in `adapters/eventbridge.py`. Here two
attempts are allowed rather than one: `ChangeMessageVisibility` on one receipt handle
is idempotent (setting the same timeout twice has one effect), so an SDK re-send cannot
duplicate anything, and a second attempt saves a receive when the first hits a blip.
A failure after both is `VisibilityUnavailable`, and the consumer still reports the item
(C0b-19).

Construction happens in `build_sqs_visibility`, called by a composition root.
